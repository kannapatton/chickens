      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl,</a> that arose from the
      red junglefowl, originally from India. They have also partially hybridized
      with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
      junglefowl, and green junglefowl). [1] Rooster and cock are terms for
      adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that
      has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a
      sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens
      primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as
      pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still
      practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and
      for eggs, they are layers.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken
      Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an immature,
      or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade
      and scientific contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as
      common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]

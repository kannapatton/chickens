        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl,</a> that arose from
        the red junglefowl, originally from India. They have also partially
        hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl,
        Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl). [1] Rooster and cock are terms
        for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A
        male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called
        a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep
        chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
        eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting,
        which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat
        are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
          Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken
          Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an
          immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still
          often in trade and scientific contexts, chicken as a species are
          typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]
